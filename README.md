# pcss Miniproject: 307 Chat

307 Chat is a chat system that offers private chatrooms, in which users decide who is a part of their chatroom.

## Installation

Currently the program is set up to run on a local host, therefore installation must include the server from corresponding reporsatorty.
Running in IDE, libraries must include JavaFX SDK 15.


## Usage

As long as the corresponding server is running, the client should be fully runnable.

Users are able to create users and login via network communication to a "userdatabase".
From there, they are able to create chatrooms in which they type the name of the chat room and the names of those they wish to include in the chat.
Only those whose names are added at creation will have access to the chatroom. As such, only the users with access will incorporate the chatroom to their chatlist.


## Contributing

For further development the project is set up using JRE 14 and JavaFX for SDK 15, and must be included in user libraries.
